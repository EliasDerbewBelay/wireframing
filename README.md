# 🧩 Wireframing

## 📖 Introduction

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the design process that involves creating simplified visual representations of a user interface. These low-fidelity sketches or digital layouts focus on structure, content placement, and user flow—without getting bogged down by colors, typography, or final aesthetics.

Wireframes act as blueprints for websites, apps, or any digital product, helping teams visualize functionality and user experience before development begins.

## 🎯 Importance in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Layout and Navigation**  
  Wireframes help designers and stakeholders understand how users will interact with the product and how information will be organized.

- **Facilitates Collaboration**  
  They serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned before moving to high-fidelity designs.

- **Saves Time and Resources**  
  By identifying usability issues early, wireframes reduce the need for costly revisions during later stages of development.

- **Focuses on User Experience**  
  Wireframing emphasizes functionality and flow, allowing teams to prioritize user needs over visual polish.
